Once a country was hijacked
Along its path to becoming great
There was no one to pay the ransom
It was too steep and far too late

The rocks had all been turned over
The creatures crawled out to attack
To murder with the bold cold expression
Of one whose boss has got their back

Now that poor dying country
Is gasping mama, mama please
Laid out bare and bleeding
With its neck beneath its leaderâ€™s knees
